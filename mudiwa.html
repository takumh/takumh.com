                How time flies. <br>
                I cannot believe it is almost July. <br>
                Remember when we met last summer.  <br> 
                And you wrote your name on a piece of paper?  <br>
                I did not remember it, what a bummer.  <br>
                And you giggled and said "that's a shame" when I asked you again later.
                <br>
                <br>
                You love lies.  <br>
                I cannot believe he made you cry.  <br>
                Remember Autumn in October, when leaves died , dried and tumbled?  <br>
                It was Fall, and you fell for Paul, when your heart leapt, darted then stumbled.  <br>
                And when it ended, you needed a friend to have it mended.
                <br>
                <br>
                Its your eyes.  <br>
                I cannot believe you never knew why.  <br>
                Remember Winter in December, when we got close?  <br>
                Then you met Tom and the conversations froze.  <br>
                I was there to advise. You were there for goodbyes.
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm breaking ties. <br>
                You took too long to reply.  <br>
                In the summer I was dumber.  <br>
                In the Fall I fell for you.  <br>
                Winter was bitter.  <br>
                Now it is Spring  <br>
                And you are no longer my fling.
                <br>
