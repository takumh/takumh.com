                It smelt like smoke. The air wore a blue hue and laces of cigarette smoke with mariuana undertones.
                It was loud. The gramophone, cacophonous laughter and lukewarm conversations were too dense for the dinghy disco. 
                I wanted to leave but you held on to me tightlv. Until all I could smell was cocoa butter swirling around vour afro. 
                Until all I could hear was vour heartbeat answering mine. And we swayed in the disco that smelled like smoke.
                <br>
                <br>
                It smelt like smoke. You wore a white veil over it, with soft laces and undertones of unmatched grace. 
                It was noisy. The band, faces singing along and voices begging us to kiss again echoed in the chapel.
                I wanted us to leave but you held onto me tightly. Until I could pick the shampoo above the smell of your burnt scalp and straightened hair under the veil.
                Until I kissed vou, not out of obligation to the pleading crowd but because I could feel our hearts beating in sync. 
                And we swaved with my head in vour hair that smelt like smoke.
                <br>
                <br>
                It smelt like smoke. The curtains were stained from all the incense mv mother burnt on the windowsill. 
                It was tumultuous. The pravers. singing and crving of vour mother's friends from church filled the room. 
                You wanted to leave but I held on to vou tightlv. Until I realized that there was no longer anything to smell, chemo had taken that.
                Until I realized that my heart was calling but there was no answer. And the curtains swayed as I cried, they smelt like smoke.
