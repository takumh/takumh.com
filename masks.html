            <p> 
                On Sunday after mass, Jonah, Amai and Thomas go to the market to buy provisions for the new school year, brittle khaki covers, 
                wrinkled plastic sheets and Jonah’s new shoes. Then they stroll home past the stalls of pungent herbs and spices, 
                past the shrill voices of women immersed in salacious gossip covered by righteous rosaries, past the men playing tsoro and drinking musombodhiya 
                and past the stall with the brooding masks.
                <br>
                The mask seller has different faces. For the city men and women who pepper their conversations with English, he smiles softly. 
                For the young touts who love to throw stones at his stall, he wears a menacing scowl. For the village folk who think him mad, 
                he puts on an indifferent stare. He has another face, of invitation and appraisal reserved for the young boy.
                <br>
                Today communion tasted like paper, like the seal flap of the tithe envelope that Mama made me lick today before mass, sealing away my dream of new school shoes.
                I forget the bitterness, of paper and broken dreams, when I see the mask seller smiling at me, his mouth a cavern bordered by black gums and sparse, nicotine-coated teeth.
                “I want to go to the mask stall” I say and Jonah laughs. “The gods are myths brother” he says, stroking his new shoes. “Beware, he is mad and they say he talks to his masks” Mama says.
                <br>
                The mask seller takes off his stare and puts on a new face, a knowing smile. He hands the boy the Muonde mask and he hesitates then puts it on, wood touching skin, ebony meeting black.
                The mask seller recites incantations, he speaks in ancient voices. And then the mask whispers......
