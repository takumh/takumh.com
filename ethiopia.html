            <p> 
                The sun does not shine in town. It blazes and burns and forces men to duck into the shade. 
                Abat buys me ice cream. He hurts me by holding on too tight. In town Abat is not the biggest thing around. 
                There are buildings: high, towering; Cars: fast, loud.
                Abat walks to town once, on Sundays, but he takes the overpriced taxi to work for six days. 
                He looks at the green robot and smiles. He pulls me too fast and the ice cream falls, splattering. 
                There are no sweet memories in town, just asphalt, melting ice cream and tears flowing. The robot turns red.
                <br>
                .
                <br>
                Abat does not laugh at home. He rages and turns and forces women to duck under tables. 
                Abat buys groceries. Abat hurts Mama by loving her too tight. 
                At home God is not the biggest thing around. 
                There is Abat: tall, towering; Arguments: sudden, loud Mama bows to God once, on Sundays, but she bows down to Abat for six days. 
                She looks at the clenched fist and cries. He punches too hard and the praying mouth falls silent, stuttering. 
                There are no adults here, just a scarred boy and a broken man. The mouth turns red.
