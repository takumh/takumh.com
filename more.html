            <div class="post">
                I grew up in Masvingo, Zimbabwe. I attended Gokomere High School for my O-levels, graduating with 12 As. 
                I attended ZRP High School for my A levels studying Pure Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics. I graduated 
                with 15 points (3 As equivalent). Some notable experiences from my time in Zimbabwe:

                        In 2017, I became the 25th President of the Junior Parliament of Zimbabwe, representing 
                        Zimbabwean youth in the country's parliament. I led a campaign to raise sanitary wear and 
                        money to purchase sanitary wear for incarcerated women and  girls in orphanages.
                        I advocated for equitable distribution of the Zimbabwe Manpower Development Fund (ZIMDEF) to
                        all high achieving students at a time when the scholarship fund was exclusively available for 
                        students studying STEM subjects. Unfortunately, the program was discontinued altogether, 
                        unrelated to my advocacy.

                        In 2019, I took a gap year. For six months, I volunteered as a custodian and care 
                        giver at a local non-profit Old People's Home in Masvingo, taking care of nearly 40 
                        residents, cleaning their quarters, mantaining their vegetable garden and grounds. 
                        I also streamlined the Home's book keeping by automating spreadsheets for budgets, 
                        donations and other records.

                        In 2019, after my volunteering, I worked as a registered Teaching Assistant with the
                        Zimbabwean Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, teaching over 250 High School 
                        students Mathematics at Maranatha High School in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. I assisted a 
                        visually impaired teacher by conducting class and evaluating the work of students. 
                        At this post, I digitized the records of the Mathematics department, migrating physical 
                        records of past examinations, former and current students and staff records to a centralised 
                        database.
